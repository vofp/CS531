\section{Introduction}
Our goal was to study to preformance of different types of agents; Memory-less Deterministic Reflex Agent, Random Reflex Agent and Memory-Based Deteministic Reflex Agent. 
We will measure the performance based on number of cleaned cells vs the number of actions taken. 
The environment is a n X m empty rectangular room with p\% chance of containing dirt. 
The agents have 5 actions; go forward, turn right by 90 degrees, turn left by 90 degrees, suck up dirt, and turn off. 
The agents also have 3 sensor to interact with the room; a wall sensor, a dirt sensor, and a home sensor. 
The memory-less Deterministic Reflex Agent
